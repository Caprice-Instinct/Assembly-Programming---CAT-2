# ICS3203-CAT2-Assembly-Wabuga Linet Wangui 151496
This repository contains assembly language programs for ICS3203 CAT 2. The programs demonstrate key concepts such as control flow, array manipulation, modular programming, and port-based simulation.


## Programs Overview
## Task 1: Control Flow and Conditional Logic
### Purpose
The program takes a user input number and classifies it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or ZERO using both conditional and unconditional jumps.

It uses assembly-level control flow instructions like je, jg, and jmp and demonstrates efficient branching logic for conditional statements.
